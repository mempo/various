Uncomfortable default settings on Debian: 


* Debian 6: if you begin any command with space, bash doesn't save this command in history. 
For example: 

$ ls  # goes in history
$  ls # does not

To save all command in history, edit $HOME/.bashrc file - comment line with HISTIGNORE    

Debian 7 hasn't this "bug" but if you update Squeeze to Wheezy with existing home, this "bug" will be too. 


* Debian 7 with Xfce4, GNOME Terminal 3.4.1.1 
Black background and text, not highlighted currently used tab. 


* Debian 7 
Power button sleeps computer without any questions
